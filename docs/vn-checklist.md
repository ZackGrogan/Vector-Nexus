    - [x] Create a simple text input field for search queries.
    - [x] Implement a button to trigger the search.
- [x] **Results Display:**
    - [x] Display search results from Qdrant.
    - [x] Include relevant data fields from the database.
    - [x] Display similarity scores from Hugging Face for comparison.

## III. Vectorization and Indexing

- [x] **Embedding Functions:**
    - [x] Develop Python functions to transform text data into embeddings.
    - [x] Implement Gemini embedding generation (if feasible).
    - [x] Implement sentence-transformers embedding generation (if Gemini is not feasible).
    - [x] Test embedding functions with sample text data.
- [x] **Qdrant Indexing:**
    - [x] Use the Qdrant client to create collections.
    - [x] Implement functions to add vectors to the Qdrant index.
    - [x] Test adding vectors to the index.
- [x] **Redis Integration:**
    - [x] Set up Redis for asynchronous task management.
    - [x] Implement a background task queue for vectorization and indexing.
    - [x] Ensure Redis is accessible from the Flask app.

## IV. Hugging Face Integration

- [ ] **Hugging Face Endpoint:**
    - [ ] Set up a Hugging Face serverless endpoint with a suitable sentence transformer model.
    - [ ] Verify the endpoint is accessible and functional.
- [ ] **Flask Hugging Face Route:**
    - [ ] Create a Flask route to send search queries to the Hugging Face endpoint.
    - [ ] Implement functions to retrieve similarity scores from the endpoint.
    - [ ] Handle API responses and errors.

## V. Dockerization

- [x] **Dockerfiles:**
    - [x] Create a Dockerfile for the Flask application.
    - [x] Create a Dockerfile for Qdrant (if not using the official image).
    - [x] Optimize Dockerfiles for size and performance.
- [x] **Docker Compose:**
    - [x] Define a `docker-compose.yml` file to manage the multi-container setup.
    - [x] Configure networking between containers.
    - [x] Test the entire system using Docker Compose.

## VI. AI-Powered Features (Gemini)

- [x] **Data Cleaning Prompts:**
    - [x] Implement prompts for missing values: "Suggest a value for this missing field based on the context: \[context\]".
    - [x] Implement prompts for inconsistencies: "Are these two entries the same? If so, suggest a standardized form: \[entry 1\], \[entry 2\]".
- [x] **Gemini Suggestions Display:**
    - [x] Display Gemini's suggestions to the user.
    - [x] Allow users to accept, modify, or reject suggestions.
- [x] **Keyword Extraction:**
    - [x] Implement a prompt for keyword extraction: "Extract the most important keywords from this text: \[text\]".
    - [x] Display extracted keywords.
- [x] **Text Embeddings (Optional):**
    - [x] Experiment with Gemini for text embeddings: "Generate a numerical vector representation of this text: \[text\]".
    - [x] Compare results with dedicated embedding models.

## VII. Testing and Validation

- [x] **End-to-End Testing:**
    - [x] Test the entire workflow from data input to search results.
    - [x] Verify data is correctly stored in SQLite.
    - [x] Verify vectors are correctly indexed in Qdrant.
    - [x] Verify search results are accurate and relevant.
- [x] **Error Handling:**
    - [x] Test error handling for API interactions (Gemini, Hugging Face, Qdrant).
    - [x] Test error handling for database interactions.
- [x] **Performance Testing:**
